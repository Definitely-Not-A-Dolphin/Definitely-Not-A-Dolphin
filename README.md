What am I doing here? I am a math nerd, not computer nerd. My friends indoctrinated me into coding and I do not know whether I like it or not.

I "know" a few programming languages:
- Python (never again)
- Javascript / TypeScript
- Svelte (yes I'm counting that, best framework btw)
- C++

Also I am learning so if you see code that just completely sucks: Do not worry, I am aware of it. Just leave an issue and I'll look into it.
I am too busy skateboarding on the learning curve.

What am I doing here? I am a math nerd, not computer nerd. My friends indoctrinated me into coding and I do not know whether I like it or not.

I "know" a few programming languages:

- Javascript / TypeScript
- Rust (learning)
- Unity's C# (learning for a school project, might look into dotnet if my other projects bore me).
 
Also I am learning so if you see code that just completely sucks: Do not worry, I am aware of it. Just leave an issue and I'll look into it.
I am too busy skateboarding on the learning curve.

Currently working on these cool projects:
- kuusi, a TypeScript backend framework utilizing file system-based routing!
- CCMath, a Rust library / crate for complex numbers. (thinking about making it a crate for general mathematics, not just complex math).
- [Geen-Dolfijn](https://geen-dolfijn.nl), my website! Made with SvelteKit and my ~love~ hate for JavaScript.
- even more I won't mention :3
